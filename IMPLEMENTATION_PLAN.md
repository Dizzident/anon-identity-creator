- üÜï **DID/VC Framework** - Full W3C-compliant Verifiable Credentials
- üÜï **Selective Disclosure** - Privacy-preserving attribute disclosure  
- üÜï **Credential Revocation** - Issuer-controlled credential invalidation
- üÜï **Advanced Storage** - Multiple storage backends (IPFS, Blockchain, File)
- üÜï **Session Management** - Secure session handling for service providers
- üÜï **Batch Operations** - Bulk verification and operations
- üÜï **Smart Contract Integration** - On-chain DID and revocation registries
- üÜï **Browser/Node.js Split** - Optimized entry points for different environments
